    <ul class="quotes">
        <li>"All you need is love? False. The four basic human necessities are air, water, food and shelter.”</li>
        <li>"I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life."</li>
        <li>"I am ready to face any challenges that might be foolish enough to face me."</li>
        <li>"In the wild, there is no healthcare. In the wild, healthcare is 'Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me, and I'm dead.' Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead."</li>
        <li>"I am fast. To give you a reference point, I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose…and a panther."</li>
        <li>"Whenever I'm about to do something, I think, 'Would an idiot do that?' And if they would, I do not do that thing."</li>
        <li>"Those who can't farm, farm celery."</li>
        <li>"Listen up kid! I don't like you. But because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights."</li>
        <li>"I love catching people in the act. That's why I always whip open doors."</li>
        <li>"Failure of any kind is failure."</li>
    </ul>
